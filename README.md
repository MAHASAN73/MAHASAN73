Hi, everybody, i am MAHASAN73, currently i am planning to build electronic leadscrew for myford super7 hobby lathe. 
for this i already have purchased launchxl F280049c. did all the cicuit as did by james clough on the bread board.
but the problem i am facing james only provided codes either for closed loop 3 phase (uvw) dc servo motors & driver or for integrated servo motor & drivers.
by the where is the codes for BI-POLAR 4 wires simple stepper motors or for closed loop (with encoder) BI-POLAR 4 wires stepper motors.
